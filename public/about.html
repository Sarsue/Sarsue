            <h3>The Journey So Far</h3>
            <p>
                My career kicked off at Nortac Defence Canada Ltd., where I worked on a team that developed and tested
                embedded software and middleware for Echo, an IP68-rated satellite tracking device. This project ensured
                secure, real-time communication, GPS tracking, and compliance with defence standards across multiple
                platforms. My contributions also led to a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CA3081732C/en"
                    target="_blank">U.S. patent</a> for situational awareness over low-bandwidth satellite systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, I joined <a
                    href="https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1kEjFEWxg-aiac-recognises-contextere-with-2022-industry-excellence-award.html"
                    target="_blank">Contextere</a> as a Lead Engineer, where I led the end-to-end development of
                Madison, an AI-powered enterprise application integrated with Microsoft Teams. Combining React, C#,
                Python, and Azure AI models, I delivered secure, scalable, and high-performance solutions for B2B and
                government clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a <a

                    target="_blank">Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert</a>, I architect cloud
                solutions that are secure, scalable, and robust. I’ve also deployed apps across AWS, Google Cloud, and
                DigitalOcean, optimizing performance and cost-efficiency.
