            <h3>Personal Journey</h3>
            <p>
                The house TV disappeared after USA 1994 world cup, just like that—replaced by books, discipline, and
                faith. At five years old,
                my protests didnt count. My days filled with football matches, choir rehearsals, and math drills. But
                everything
                changed in 1997 when a bulky personal computer arrived at our home. My father, an accountant, used it
                for
                work, but I was mesmerized by the blinking cursor on the screen. At first, I played games, but soon I
                was
                navigating Excel spreadsheets and Access databases, sitting beside my dad as he explained formulas and
                data
                structures. I was hooked before I even knew what programming was.
            </p>
            <p>
                School came naturally—science, math, literature—but when my dad asked about my future, I rattled off
                grand
                ambitions of becoming a millionaire. He chuckled, shaking his head, “That’s not a profession.”
                Engineering
                seemed like the sensible choice, promising high salaries in oil and gas. So, I followed the tide,
                unaware
                that technology had already chosen me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Preparing for the SATs, I had one foot in the U.S. education system when my parents stumbled upon a
                Canadian
                high school program that accepted the WAEC. Within a year, I was in Canada, skipping through courses and
                finishing high school ahead of schedule. One class, Pascal programming, changed everything. The teacher
                wasn’t just explaining syntax—he was teaching us how to think. Each challenge felt like a puzzle waiting
                to
                be solved, and I couldn’t get enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                When university admissions redirected me from Petroleum Engineering to Computer Systems Engineering, I
                took
                it as a sign. My first semester, ECOR 1606, was an electrifying dive into problem-solving. Then came
                the class with
                a 3D printer project that felt like something out of science fiction, and the thrill of building
                real-world
                solutions. I learned to balance nights of debugging with campus life, piecing together an identity that
                was
                equal parts engineer and explorer.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my final year project, I built an exam scheduling system. It had potential—real potential. But after
                graduation, I shelved it, drowning in job applications instead. Years later, as I watched scheduling
                software carve out entire industries, I often wondered: What if I had believed in my idea just a little
                more?
            </p>

            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
                My career started at a startup specializing in situational command and control (SCC). In those eight
                years
                (2011-2019), I wasn’t just coding—I was solving problems that had life-or-death consequences. One of my
                proudest contributions was the <a
                    href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/track24-defence-launches-new-canadian-built-beyond-line-of-sight-satellite-device"
                    target="_blank">Echo</a>, a satellite device designed for secure, beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS)
                communication used by special forces. Seeing it integrate seamlessly with the Track24 SCC TITAN system
                was
                more than an achievement—it was proof that technology could be a silent guardian in the most critical
                situations. That work led to a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CA3081732C/en"
                    target="_blank">U.S. patent</a>, a milestone that reinforced my passion for building solutions that
                truly matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, AI and machine learning pulled me into <a
                    href="https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1kEjFEWxg-aiac-recognises-contextere-with-2022-industry-excellence-award.html"
                    target="_blank"> Contextere </a>, where I led the development of an AI-driven
                platform for blue-collar workers. I wasn’t just coding—I was bridging the gap between business leaders,
                engineers, and end-users, ensuring that technology wasn’t just innovative, but actually useful. Every
                project was a lesson in translating ideas into scalable, impactful software.

            <h3>Present Focus</h3>
            <p>
                Today, I work as a freelance software engineer, specializing in scalable solutions that solve real
                business
                challenges. My focus has shifted deeper into AI, where I’m building <a href="https://www.syntextai.com/"
                    target="_blank">SynTextAI</a>—a platform designed to extract meaningful insights from documents
                using
                AI. It’s more than just another tool; it’s about unlocking the hidden potential in information, making
                decisions faster and smarter.
