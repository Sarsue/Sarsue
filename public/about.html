            <h3>My Journey: From Curiosity to Code</h3>
            <p>
                It all kicked off in 1997 when a clunky PC landed in my house. What started with tinkering in
                spreadsheets and databases turned into a full-on obsession with cracking problems through tech. High
                school introduced me to Pascal, and I realized coding wasn’t just a tool, it was my way of attacking
                challenges head-on.
            </p>
            <p>
                University locked it in. I started in Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering but jumped to Computer Systems
                Engineering because I craved building stuff that works in the real world. From hacking embedded systems
                to launching an exam scheduling platform as my final project, I learned how to turn ideas into solutions
                that deliver.
            </p>

            <h3>The Hustle in Action</h3>
            <p>
                My career kicked off at a situational command and control (SCC) startup, where I built software that had
                to work—no excuses. One standout? <a
                    href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/track24-defence-launches-new-canadian-built-beyond-line-of-sight-satellite-device"
                    target="_blank">Echo</a>—a satellite device I developed for special forces, enabling secure
                beyond-line-of-sight comms. Integrated with the Track24 SCC TITAN system, it snagged a <a
                    href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CA3081732C/en" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a> and proved
                tech can be a lifeline when it’s done right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to that I ported an AES encryption module to LUA, clinching a high-stakes Saudi deal.
                That wasn’t just a coding win, it was a business save, showing I can bridge the gap between tech
                headaches and bottom-line results.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, I joined <a
                    href="https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1kEjFEWxg-aiac-recognises-contextere-with-2022-industry-excellence-award.html"
                    target="_blank">Contextere</a> to lead an AI platform for blue-collar workers. The mission: deliver
                AI
                in real life context. It had to solve real problems and deliver value where it counts—on the
                ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a <a

                    target="_blank">Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert</a>, I architect cloud
                solutions that are secure, scalable, and tough as nails. I’ve also deployed apps across AWS, Google
                Cloud, and DigitalOcean, squeezing every ounce of performance and savings out of cloud-native tech.
            </p>

            <h3>What I’m Building Now</h3>
            <p>
                Today, I’m all about scalable AI that tackles real pain points. My latest hustle, <a
                    href="https://www.syntextai.com/" target="_blank">SynTextAI</a>, uses AI to understand documents,
                pulling out insights that drive smarter decisions and unlock potential others miss.
