            <h3>Personal Journey</h3>
            <p>
                My fascination with technology began in 1997 when a bulky personal computer arrived at our home. What
                started as a curiosity about spreadsheets and databases quickly became a deep passion for
                problem-solving. By the time I encountered Pascal programming in high school, I realized that coding
                wasn’t just a skill—it was a way of thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                University cemented this mindset. Initially set on Mechanical/ Aerospace Engineering, I pivoted to
                Computer Systems
                Engineering, drawn by the thrill of building real-world solutions. From my first exposure to embedded
                systems to developing an exam scheduling platform for my final-year project, I saw firsthand how
                technology could transform ideas into impact.
            </p>

            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I started my career at a situational command and control (SCC) startup, where I developed
                mission-critical software. One of my most rewarding projects was <a
                    href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/track24-defence-launches-new-canadian-built-beyond-line-of-sight-satellite-device"
                    target="_blank">Echo</a>, a satellite device enabling secure beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS)
                communication for special forces. This work, which integrated with the Track24 SCC TITAN system, earned
                a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CA3081732C/en" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a>—proof that
                technology, when applied right, can save lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another defining moment came when I ported our AES encryption module to LUA, securing a high-stakes
                Saudi contract. This project reinforced my ability to bridge technical challenges with strategic
                business needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, I transitioned to <a

                    target="_blank">Contextere</a>, leading the development of an AI-driven platform for blue-collar
                workers. My focus was ensuring that AI wasn’t just cutting-edge but also practical—delivering real value
                where it mattered most.
