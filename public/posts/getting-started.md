# Building Products with AI
*Published on January 30, 2025*

"You need three things to create a successful startup: good people, a product customers want, and minimal expenses." - Paul Graham

## Getting Started 

A front-end engineer spins up a backend service in minutes, deploys it, and watches real-time analytics roll in—no waiting for a specialized team. A solo developer, armed with patience and persistence, launches an AI-driven tool that automates their work, freeing up time while the revenue streams in.

A frustrated operations manager spends hours sifting through disorganized data—until a startup builds an AI tool that automates the process. A regional business struggles with software that doesn’t support local languages—until an entrepreneur customizes an open-source alternative. 

A small team—just a CEO, CTO, and CFO—runs a billion-dollar company, powered by AI agents that handle operations, customer support, and even code generation.

The secret? Solving real problems efficiently. Experience used to be the bottleneck, but AI closes the gap. Now, anyone with firsthand knowledge of a problem can leverage AI to engineer the solution—without years of trial and error.

The best ideas don’t appear out of nowhere; they emerge from real pain points, transforming frustration into opportunity. Businesses and individuals are willing to pay for solutions that remove friction, especially when efficiency translates directly into profit. Some of the most impactful innovations don’t require reinvention—just refinement. A product gains value when it’s open-source, more affordable, region-specific, or tailored to a niche.

Technology has always evolved around choice. Operating systems, once a rigid battle between Windows and macOS, have fractured into ecosystems tailored to diverse needs. Linux, the backbone of cloud computing, mobile devices, and enterprise servers, doesn’t exist as a singular experience—it manifests in countless variations, each optimized for a specific user. A security researcher booting up Tails is engaging with a vastly different world than a developer fine-tuning their Arch Linux setup, even though both operate on the same foundation. The same holds true for browsers: Chrome prioritizes speed, Brave champions privacy, Safari integrates seamlessly into Apple’s ecosystem. These differences aren’t just surface-level—they define the experience.

AI is reaching this same inflection point. DeepSeek R1’s success signals that the model itself is no longer the sole focus. The true value lies in the app layer—the interface, experience, and workflow that bring AI to life. Take Perplexity AI, for example. It doesn’t just demonstrate the raw capabilities of large language models; it refines them into an intuitive, research-driven assistant. This isn’t just about building better models—it’s about crafting the experiences that define how AI fits into our lives.

Inspired by the success of Perplexity AI, I want to build Syntext—a powerful AI search tool designed to go beyond the web. The goal is simple: make it seamless to search PDFs, videos, niche document formats, and the web, all in one place. Whether it’s research papers, technical manuals, or multimedia content, Syntext should be able to find answers wherever they exist.

Building AI products is easier than ever, but real success comes from utility and adoption. If I can get 50,000 users, that’s success. That’s proof that this kind of search tool is needed. Now, it’s just a matter of building it.

## Building SyntextAI: Speed, Simplicity, and Scalability
Building SyntextAI isn’t about over-engineering from day one—it’s about moving fast, keeping it simple, and ensuring it scales when the time comes. The first step is speed: getting a working prototype out the door, gathering real-world feedback, and refining based on actual user needs, not assumptions. Simplicity drives the core functionality—process documents, handle queries, and return answers with proper source attribution. No fluff, just results. But simplicity doesn’t mean short-sightedness. Scalability is baked into the foundation, choosing React and Python not just for their efficiency, but because they attract skilled developers who can contribute as the product grows. Even the LLM itself is fluent in these languages, making integrations smoother. The goal is clear: ship fast, solve real problems, and build something that lasts.

## User-Centered Design (UCD)
When designing a successful product, the foundation starts with the design—everything else, from backend code to marketing, follows from there. First and foremost, the front-end experience shapes how users interact with the app. It’s crucial to focus on how data gets into our system, ensuring the process is smooth, intuitive, and user-friendly. The user’s journey through the app needs to be seamless—whether they’re navigating or entering information—minimizing friction at every touchpoint. We need to think beyond just the user interface and focus on the overall experience: how easy is it for a user to accomplish their goals? Is the app intuitive, with clear directions and support when needed? From there, we look at discoverability—how will users find the app? What search terms or pain points will drive them to our solution? By addressing these factors thoughtfully and thoroughly, we ensure that the app is not only functional but also easy to use, and positioned to attract the right users before we even begin worrying about backend infrastructure.

As an aspiring designer, I focused on several key principles to guide the design process and create an intuitive user experience. The first critical point I considered was usability and accessibility, ensuring that the app would be easy to navigate with minimal cognitive load. I aimed for a simple, clean layout where users could find what they needed quickly, reducing frustration. To enhance this, I prioritized consistency and familiarity by using standard UI patterns and well-known design systems, such as tabs, buttons, and forms, which would feel familiar to users across different platforms. Finally, I emphasized the importance of feedback and affordances. I wanted users to receive real-time responses for their actions, whether it's through loading indicators, button states, or confirmation messages, to give them a sense of control and clarity. These core principles, though simple, guided my decisions in creating an accessible and effective design.


## Anatomy of A Product

1. **Landing Page with Google Authentication**  
   A visitor lands on the page, no clutter, no distractions—just a clear, compelling message about what SyntextAI does. A single button: “Sign in with Google.” No lengthy forms, no forgotten passwords, just instant access. It’s familiar, it’s secure, and it signals trust. The same way a blue checkmark on Twitter reassures legitimacy, authentication through Google or Microsoft Entra ID tells users this isn’t some fly-by-night project. It’s built for real work, designed for professionals, and ready to scale. The landing page isn’t just an entry point—it’s the first marketing asset, the first trust signal, the first conversion.

2. **Core Functionality**  
 Every decision in building Syntext is a trade-off between simplicity, scalability, and user experience. WebSockets or SSE might be the ideal choice for real-time streaming, but long polling keeps things simple, avoiding connection management overhead while still delivering a smooth experience. Complexity for complexity’s sake is a trap; the goal is to ship fast and iterate.

On the RAG side, we take a pragmatic approach. Instead of rigid, fixed-size chunks, we break documents down by sentences but retrieve them in segments that fit naturally within the LLM’s context window. This ensures more coherent responses, reducing hallucinations while keeping processing efficient. Balancing model cost, multilingual proficiency, and creativity is another challenge—every token costs, but cutting corners on language understanding limits accessibility. The right trade-offs mean the product doesn’t just work; it feels natural in conversation.

3. **Settings Page with Stripe Integration**  
A user finds value, they’re ready to subscribe—no hurdles, no friction. With Stripe, payment isn’t an afterthought; it’s a seamless extension of the experience. A few clicks, and access is unlocked, no clunky redirects or hidden fees. The same trust that makes people comfortable entering their card details on major platforms is built into the checkout flow. Recurring billing, trials, upgrades—handled effortlessly. Monetization isn’t just about charging users; it’s about making payment so smooth that it never feels like a barrier.A user finds value, they’re ready to subscribe—no hurdles, no friction.

### Why This Approach?
Instead of perfecting a product for months, the goal is rapid validation. By leveraging existing tools like Google Auth and Stripe, we focus on delivering immediate value.
Now that the MVP is live, the next step is gathering feedback, refining UX, and expanding features based on user needs. Success in AI isn't about perfection—it’s about iteration, testing, and solving real problems.
Building products with AI isn’t just about speeding up development—it’s about creating a smart, adaptive workflow that keeps you in tune with user needs, optimizes your resources, and allows for rapid testing and adjustments.
