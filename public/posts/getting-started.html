        <h2>Building Products with AI</h2>
        <p>Published on January 30, 2025</p>

        <blockquote>
            "You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something
            customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible." - Paul Graham
        </blockquote>

        <p>AI drives productivity. Soon, we’ll see billion-dollar companies led by just a CEO, CTO, and CFO. AI bridges
            the gap from idea to execution. Paul Graham says success comes from being frugal, working with passionate
            people—whom he calls "animals"—and building things customers truly want. The real challenge is figuring out
            what people actually want.</p>

        <p>Ideas often stem from pain—a problem or need you encounter, whether at work or in your personal life. Solving
            work problems is more lucrative than life problems as businesses spend money more than consumers.</p>

        <p>Cloning a successful app is another way to generate ideas. Can you create an open-source version? Can you
            make it cheaper, offer it in a new geography, or apply it to a different domain or niche? Maybe add a new
            use case? These are all strong ways to start.</p>

        <h3>AI Models Are Like Web Browsers</h3>
        <p>AI Models are analogous to web browsers. There isn’t just one browser—there’s Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Tor,
            and
            Safari. Each serves different users with unique needs. Some focus on privacy, others on speed, security, or
            niche use cases. The same will happen with AI. There won’t be just one dominant AI model—there will be
            different flavors. Some will serve specific industries, some will cater to different geographies, others
            will introduce better use cases, new pricing models, or even open-source alternatives.</p>

        <p>I am building SyntextAI to challenge myself and see if I could create something thousands of people would
            use. It started with a simple question: how can I make research easier, faster, and more accessible?
            Perplexity and Deepnote are already doing their part, but there’s room for more. SyntextAI could be an
            alternative—a tool built for niche markets, supporting more file types, and offering flexibility where
            others don’t.</p>

        <p>And we’re thinking beyond just one region. SyntextAI is designed with global reach in mind. We want people
            everywhere to have the tools they need, tailored to their local language, regulations, and industry
            standards.</p>

        <h3>Building the SyntextAI MVP: Speed, Simplicity, and Scalability</h3>
        <p>When building an MVP, speed matters. The goal is to test an idea quickly, see if users engage with it, and
            iterate based on real feedback. I decided to integrate existing technologies to accelerate the rollout of
            SyntextAI, focusing on getting a functional prototype into users' hands as fast as possible.</p>

        <h4>Here’s how I structured the MVP:</h4>

        <h5>1. Landing Page with Google Authentication</h5>
        <p>First impressions count. The landing page is the first thing users see, so it needed to be clean, simple, and
            functional. Instead of a lengthy sign-up process, I implemented Google Authentication, allowing users to
            sign in with a single click. This not only removes friction but also improves security by leveraging
            Google’s authentication framework.</p>

        <h5>2. Core App Functionality</h5>
        <p>The heart of the MVP is the app’s ability to process, analyze, and extract insights from documents. Rather
            than over-engineering the initial version, I focused on the core research assistant functionality—uploading
            files, parsing content, and delivering structured responses. The backend was kept simple but efficient,
            ensuring that users could start getting value immediately without a steep learning curve.</p>

        <h5>3. Settings Page with Stripe Integration</h5>
        <p>Monetization had to be built in from day one. Many great ideas fail because they lack a clear business model.
            To test whether people would pay for SyntextAI, I integrated Stripe for handling subscriptions and payments.
            The settings page allows users to manage their account, view their subscription status, and easily upgrade
            if they need additional features.</p>

        <h3>Why This Approach?</h3>
        <p>Instead of spending months on a perfect, fully polished product, I wanted to validate the demand first. By
            leveraging Google Auth and Stripe, I was able to focus on what truly
            matters—delivering a useful AI-powered research tool that people could actually use.</p>

        <p>With the MVP live, the next step is gathering feedback, refining the user experience, and expanding features
            based on real user needs. The key to launching a successful AI product isn’t perfection—it’s rapid
            iteration, real-world testing, and solving actual problems.</p>
