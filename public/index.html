      <h2>The Genesis</h2>
      <p>
        Pregnancy changes a woman’s brain. When my mother carried me, she faced health complications that could have
        taken one or both of our lives. Problem-solving is instinctual to most humans. Consciousness demands
        creativity—or the mirroring of what works best. Adapt or die.
      </p>

        Mom left Catholicism for Pentecostalism, the strict kind. No TV, no worldly distractions—only holiness. I
        survived. Her influence grew, and so did the impact of her new community. By the time I was five, the TV was
        gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        My childhood was filled with football games, singing in the church choir, and lessons in math, languages,
        debate, and drama. I had games like Tetris, but most of my time was spent either daydreaming or learning. Then,
        in '97, the personal computer arrived in our home. My dad, an accountant, needed it for work, but I quickly
        became fascinated by it. At first, I played games—Shadow Knights, Dangerous Dave, Wolf 3D. Soon, the computer
        and I became inseparable. I didn't like it when Dad needed it for business apps like Access and Excel. The
        screen became my new window to both learning and escape. Eventually, Dad taught me how to use Access and Excel.
        He became my first programming teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        In school, I excelled in science and math, and I did well in literature and the arts. One day, my dad asked me
        what I wanted to become. I saw ads for "millionaires" in Nigerian newspapers, and my growing mind latched onto
        the idea, thinking it was a career. But Dad jokingly replied, "Millionaire isn't a profession." He suggested I
        could make millions in engineering, law, medicine, or accounting. I chose the path of least resistance—Petroleum
        or Mechanical Engineering, as oil companies paid engineers a fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        After high school, I was set on the SATs for the USA when my parents enrolled me in a computer business program.
        I’d already spent too much time on a computer for a kid from the third world. Then they found an ad for a
        Canadian high school program that accepted the Nigerian WAEC. After a year, I could go to a Canadian university.
        They thought it was a better path than the SATs. I finished high school early, having skipped most of the
        classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        At my Canadian high school, I enrolled in a Pascal programming class. The teacher drilled us in problem-solving,
        and every detail etched itself into my mind. When I applied to study Petroleum or Mechanical Engineering, they
        redirected me to Computer Systems Engineering, and I went with the flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my first semester at university, I fell for ECOR 1606, the problem-solving course. Later, I tackled Matlab
        2606. I was using tools to solve real-world problems. The first version of the 3D printer, with all its
        capabilities, blew my mind. I found a balance between learning and partying.
      </p>
      <p>
        My final year project was a scheduling system for exams. At the time, this problem had real potential. If I’d
        been more serious and had more belief in myself, I could have continued working on it after graduation instead
        of endlessly applying for jobs. There are now software scheduling apps that have created real value for their
        creators.

      <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
      <p>
        At my first job, I joined a startup focused on situational command and control (SCC) solutions, working on both
        the device and applications for mobile, desktop, and web users. It was a small company, but I spent eight years
        there (2011-2019), learning a great deal along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key products I worked on was the Echo, a beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) satellite device designed for
        secure blue force tracking and command and control. The Echo was ruggedized and waterproof, built to withstand
        harsh environments and used for mission-critical applications in the defense sector. It integrated seamlessly
        with the Track24 SCC TITAN system, providing reliable communications and situational awareness. I helped design
        the device and ensured it could connect to various devices, including tablets, smartphones, and sensors, to
        transmit real-time data. <a

          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work was groundbreaking, and my contributions to the project ultimately led to a U.S. patent for the
        technology we
        developed. You can view the U.S. patent <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CA3081732C/en"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The product was adopted by special forces, giving me a
        unique perspective on how
        technology can enable real-time decision-making in extreme conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2019, I became deeply interested in AI and machine learning, and Contextere offered me the opportunity to
        lead a team in developing an AI platform for blue-collar workers. Over the past five years, I’ve been at the
        heart of software creation, bridging the gap between business leaders, technologists, and end users.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my role, I navigate the complexities of turning business ideas into tangible products. I collaborated closely
        with C-level executives, product designers, and business stakeholders to define the vision. Then, I guided the
        software engineering teams in bringing those ideas to life. Whether it's ensuring the product meets security
        standards, aligning database architecture with our goals, or collaborating with UX/UI teams to create intuitive
        designs, I ensure every part of the system functions together seamlessly.
